CLUSTERING ANALYSIS COMPLETE
======================================================================

METHODOLOGY:
- Algorithm: K-Means Clustering
- Optimal clusters: 3
- Countries analyzed: 212
- Features used: 6
- Data period: 1961-2022 (62 years)

MODEL QUALITY:
- Silhouette Score: 0.4798 (good separation)
- Davies-Bouldin Index: 0.9354 (lower is better)
- Calinski-Harabasz: 184.77 (higher is better)

CLUSTER SIZES:
- Cluster 0 (Stable Low-Warming Group): 138 countries (65.1%)
- Cluster 1 (Recent Acceleration Group): 52 countries (24.5%)
- Cluster 2 (High-Impact Rapid Warmers): 22 countries (10.4%)

KEY INSIGHTS:
The analysis demonstrates that global warming is not a uniform phenomenon; rather, countries exhibit distinct warming behaviors driven by geographic and climatic factors. High-latitude continental regions, particularly in the Arctic and Eastern Europe, form a cluster of rapid warmers, whereas island nations typically experience more moderate temperature increases due to oceanic thermal inertia. This heterogeneity implies that a "one-size-fits-all" approach is ineffective; adaptation strategies must be tailored to the specific warming profile—whether rapid acceleration or steady increase—of each cluster.

DELIVERABLES:
✓ Clustering model with optimal k selection
✓ Country cluster assignments
✓ Cluster profiles and characteristics
✓ Visualization plots (PCA, distributions)
✓ Business recommendations by cluster
✓ Geographic analysis of clusters
