CLUSTERING ANALYSIS COMPLETE
======================================================================

METHODOLOGY:
- Algorithm: K-Means Clustering
- Optimal clusters: 3
- Countries analyzed: 212
- Features used: 6
- Data period: 1961-2022 (62 years)

MODEL QUALITY:
- Silhouette Score: 0.4798 (good separation)
- Davies-Bouldin Index: 0.9354 (lower is better)
- Calinski-Harabasz: 184.77 (higher is better)

CLUSTER SIZES:
- Cluster 0 (Stable Low-Warming Group): 138 countries (65.1%)
- Cluster 1 (Recent Acceleration Group): 52 countries (24.5%)
- Cluster 2 (High-Impact Rapid Warmers): 22 countries (10.4%)

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. Countries show distinct warming patterns, not uniform global change
2. Geographic and climate factors create natural groupings
3. Different clusters require different adaptation strategies
4. High-warming clusters concentrated in Arctic/continental regions
5. Island nations show lower temperature change but face other risks

DELIVERABLES:
✓ Clustering model with optimal k selection
✓ Country cluster assignments
✓ Cluster profiles and characteristics
✓ Visualization plots (PCA, distributions)
✓ Business recommendations by cluster
✓ Geographic analysis of clusters

NEXT STEPS:
1. Integrate clustering results into Streamlit app
2. Create interactive cluster exploration dashboard
3. Combine with regression projections for cluster-specific forecasts
4. Develop targeted policy recommendations per cluster
