⚠️  CRITICAL LIMITATIONS OF COUNTRY-LEVEL AGGREGATION:

1. GEOGRAPHIC HETEROGENEITY
   - Large countries (Russia, Canada, China) aggregate vastly different climate zones
   - Elongated countries (Chile, Argentina) span multiple climatic bands
   - Mountain ranges create microclimates not captured in national averages
   
2. LOSS OF REGIONAL SIGNAL
   - Arctic regions warming 2-3x faster than tropics
   - Coastal vs inland temperature differences
   - Urban heat island effects averaged with rural areas
   
3. POTENTIAL BIASES
   - Weather station distribution may favor populated areas
   - Historical data quality varies by country
   - Different baseline periods for some countries
   
4. EXAMPLES OF AGGREGATION ISSUES:
   - Chile: Single value for 4,300 km (desert → ice fields)
   - Russia: 17M km² with 9 time zones reduced to one number
   - USA: Alaska to Hawaii aggregated together
   
5. RECOMMENDED APPROACH FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS:
   - Use gridded climate data (e.g., 1°x1° resolution)
   - Analyze by climate zones (Köppen classification)
   - Weight by land area and population density
   - Consider elevation as additional dimension
   
6. IMPLICATIONS FOR THIS PROJECT:
   ✅ Trends and patterns at country level ARE still meaningful
   ✅ Comparative analysis between countries IS valid
   ⚠️  Absolute values should be interpreted with caution
   ⚠️  Regional policy recommendations require finer resolution data
   
7. VALIDATION STRATEGY:
   - Compare results with peer-reviewed literature
   - Cross-reference with regional climate reports (IPCC)
   - Acknowledge uncertainty ranges in conclusions
